# Work packages (WP):

## WP 1: 

Subset Pvalb+ count matrices for each of the brain regions described in Table 1.  

## WP 2: 

Generate a Pvalb+ specific expression profile based on gene signatures for each of the sub-clusters defined in Table 1. Compare profile across each dataset and determine a robust gene expression signature for Pvalb+ cells that can be utilised for later work packages.        	

## WP 3: 

In each study contrast the gene expression profile of Pvalb+ cells against the remaining GABAergic cell types. Provide a ranked list based on uniqueness OR prioritised gene expression in Pvalb+ cells. NOTE: presently several methods exist to define genes expressed in one cell class over another â€“ this can be discussed further.   

1.	Habib: Pvalb-Tac1 versus GABA clusters in PFC only.
2.	Lake 2016: In6 versus all remaining In groups in BA10 only.
3.	Lake 2016: In6a/b versus all remaining In groups in BA10 only.
  
## WP 4:

Repeat above in all neuronal cell classes and then all cells in dataset.
